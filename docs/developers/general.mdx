# General

## Common Patterns

These are general features and how-to's inside of Apollo. 
You will see these options appear throughout Apollo and while reading the documentation.

We recommend you use and understand these general features.

### Player

#### Checking if player is running Lunar Client

```java
boolean runningLunarClient = Apollo.getPlayerManager().hasSupport(player.getUniqueId());
```

#### Getting an ApolloPlayer object by player UUID

```java
Optional<ApolloPlayer> apolloPlayer = Apollo.getPlayerManager().getPlayer(player.getUniqueId());
```

#### Get all players running Lunar Client

```java
Collection<ApolloPlayer> playersRunningLunarClient = Apollo.getPlayerManager().getPlayers();
```

### Module

#### Get a specific module

```java
BorderModule borderModule = Apollo.getModuleManager().getModule(BorderModule.class);
```

### Recipients

#### Creating recipients with a single Apollo Player

```java
apolloPlayer.ifPresent(apolloPlayerObject -> {
    Recipients recipients = apolloPlayerObject;
});
```

#### Creating recipients with all players running Lunar Client

```java
Recipients allRecipients = Recipients.ofEveryone();
```

#### Creating recipients with all players running Lunar Client with names shorter than 6 characters

```java
Recipients filteredRecipients = Recipients.of(
    Apollo.getPlayerManager().getPlayers().stream()
        .filter(online -> online.getName().length() < 6)
        .collect(Collectors.toList())
);
```
